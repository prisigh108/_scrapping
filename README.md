# _scrapping

#In this project, I have  have scrapped the store details of Nykaa outlets using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. Only some outlets have there phone number mentioned on the site and so few column have none value. 
I used ArcGIS Geocoding services to find latitude and longitude of address. A function was define for this purpose. 
At last the data is stored in csv format file.
